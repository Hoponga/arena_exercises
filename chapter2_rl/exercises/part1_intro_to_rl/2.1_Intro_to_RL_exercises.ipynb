        "`gymnasium` is the new standard for RL environments, and we'll be using it for the rest of this chapter. The rest of the material will just discuss `gymnasium` directly, but we've included here a list of the important differences between `gym==0.23.1` (the version previously used in the ARENA exercises) and `gymnasium==0.29.0`, just in case you want to transfer your old code over (full details can be found [here](https://gymnasium.farama.org/introduction/migration_guide/)). There were also some significant changes made between gymnasium versions `0.29.0` and the current `1.0.0`, but we aren't working with these because they don't offer any major benefits for our purposes (and in particular they handle things like terminal observations and video recording in a pretty annoying way).\n",
        "\n",
        "**5 objects returned in `env.step`, not 4**. In version `0.23.1` of the original gym library, the `env.step` method returned 4 objects: `observation, reward, done, info`. Implicitly, `done` was actually defined as `terminated or truncated`, where `truncated` is true if the episode has timed out and `terminated` is true if the episode ends for non-time related reasons (e.g. the agent has fallen off a cliff). In `gymnasium` (or more recent versions of `gym`), we split this into 2 variables, i.e. `env.step` returns the 5-tuple of `observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2 objects returned in `env.reset`, not 1**. In version `0.23.1` of the original gym library, the `env.reset` method returned a single object: `obs` (the observation). In `gymnasium`, it returns 2 objects: `observation` and `info` (the latter of which is the same as the `info` object returned by the `step` method conventionally).\n",
        "\n",
        "**The `infos` object is different in vectorized environments.** previously it was a list of dicts (one per env), now it's a dict of lists. We make the following replacements:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Render mode**. You need to create video-based environments by passing `render_mode=\"rgb_array\"` into `gym.make`. When you do this, you don't also need to call `mode=\"rgb_array\"` in the `render` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "infos[env_idx][\"episode\"][\"l\"] \t\t   -> infos[\"final_info\"][env_idx][\"episode\"][\"l\"]\n",
        "infos[env_idx][\"terminal_observation\"] -> infos[\"final_observation\"][env_idx]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Handling terminal obversations.** Previously the `next_obs` returned from `envs.step` would be the reset observation of the new episode if we terminated, and we'd have to go into the `infos` dictionary to see the true terminal observation. Now, `next_obs` is the true terminal observation (i.e. the thing that's out of bounds), and when we terminate there's acutally an `_autoreset_envs` flag which is set to true, and makes sure our environment is reset when we take the next step. So in those cases, we need to be careful that the starting `obs` we use is actually the new observation, rather than the terminal observation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Random seeding.** The `Env.seed()` method no longer exists, and is now replaced with `Env.reset(seed=seed)`.\n",

        "<!-- *If you're happy continuing to work with `gym`, then skip this section!*\n",
        "\n",
        "We're using a relatively old version of `gym` (0.23.1), rather than the more recent (and maintained `gymnasium`). This is because RL libraries are notoriously buggy and susceptible to breaking changes, and we're working with a version which we know is compatible with the material. Annoyingly this version of gym is only compatible with `wandb==0.13.10` rather than the more recent `0.16` versions, which is why we've fixed that version in the requirements file.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to transition to `gymnasium`, it is possible (most of the material has been tested with gymnasium as well), but we chose not to make the transition because it wasn't worth all the breaking changes. A few bits of guidance if you want to use `gymanasium`:\n",
        "\n",
        "- We recommend pinning version `gymnasium==0.29.0`.\n",
        "- You should replace `import gym.(x)` with `import gymnasiumn.(x)`, and replace `import gym` with `import gymnasium as gym`.\n",
        "- The most important change is that `env.step` no longer returns 4 objects, it returns 5: `done` is split into `terminated` and `truncated`.\n",
        "\t- `terminated` tells you whether the episode has ended because of environment-specific reasons (e.g. the cartpole has fallen over), and `truncated` tells you whether the episode has ended because the maximum number of steps has been reached. The relationship is `done = terminated or truncated`.\n",
        "\t- You can deal with this by simply defining `done = terminated or truncated` everywhere (or the `|` operator if you're dealing with arrays), and use `done` in the same way as before. However, you could also try and use `terminated` rather than `truncated` when appropriate. Using `done` will only incentivize the agent to maximize its reward within the episode length (e.g. it could always fall over at the 499th step in CartPole-v0 and this would still be fine), but using `terminated` will have different behavioural effects. Can you see why this is?\n",
        "\t- In day 1 material, you'll need to return a 5-tuple rather than a 4-tuple. Often this will just involve inserting `truncated=False` into the return tuple.\n",
        "- `obs.reset()` now returns a 2-tuple of `obs, info` rather than just `obs`.\n",
        "- The `infos` object is structured differently: it's a dict of lists, not a list of dicts.\n",
        "\t- You should replace `infos[environment][\"episode\"]` with `infos[\"final_info\"][environment][\"episode\"]`, and `infos[environment][\"terminal_observation\"]` with `infos[\"final_observation\"][environment]`.\n",
        "- Remove `self.seed()` in the probes.\n",
        "- Pass `render_mode=\"rgb_array\"` into `gym.make` in the `make_envs` utils function.\n",
        "- Comment out the `test_agent` function.\n",
        "- When using atari, you'll want to use the gymnsasium library's built-in wrappers (found [here](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/wrappers/misc_wrappers/)), not the stuff in `atari_wrappers.py`. -->\n",

        "Usually, RL code fails silently, which makes it difficult to be confident that you don't have any bugs. I had a bug in my first attempt that made both versions appear to perform equally, and there were only 13 lines of code, and I had written similar code before.\n",

Even in this simple problem, we already have two different ways to encourage exploration (`epsilon` and `optimism`), and it's not clear whether it's better to use one or the other, or both in some combination. It's actually worse than that, because `epsilon` should probably be annealed down at some rate.\n",

        "Even in this single comparison, we trained 200 agents for each version. Is that a big number or a small number to estimate the effect size? Probably we should like, compute some statistics?

        "So, we now have a way to compute the value of a policy. What we are really interested in is finding better policies. One way we can do this is to compare how well $\\pi$ performs on a state versus the value obtained by choosing another action instead, that is, the Q-value. If there is an action $a'$ for which $Q_{\\pi}(s,a') > V_\\pi(s) \\equiv Q_\\pi(s, \\pi(s))$, then we would prefer that $\\pi$ take action $a'$ in state $s$ rather than whatever action $\\pi(s)$ currently is. Recall that we could write out our Bellman equation like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "Q_\\pi(s,a) = \\sum_{s'} T(s' \\mid s,a) \\left( R(s, a, s') + \\gamma V_\\pi(s') \\right)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "which gives us an update rule for our policy $\\pi$, given that we've evaluated $V_\\pi$ using our closed-form expression from earlier:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. For each possible state $s$ and action $a$, calculate the thing on the right hand side of this expression\n",
        "2. Take argmax over $a$, and this gives us the new action that we should take in state $s$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Or in other words:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
